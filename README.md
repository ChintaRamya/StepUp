# Goal & Habit Tracking Desktop Application

## Overview
This project is a desktop application designed to help individuals track their personal goals, daily tasks, and progress over time. It emphasizes self-improvement by providing a clear structure for setting objectives, maintaining streaks, and building consistent habits.  

Unlike traditional to-do lists that focus only on task completion, this system highlights progress continuity by tracking streaks, encouraging users to stay motivated and disciplined. Each task or goal can be logged, updated, and monitored, giving users real-time insights into their productivity patterns.  

By combining a task management interface with habit tracking features, the application supports both short-term and long-term personal development. The intuitive design ensures ease of use, while the offline-first nature of the desktop environment allows users to access and manage their goals anytime.  

Through this approach, the application fosters accountability, consistency, and measurable growth, empowering users to stay aligned with their personal and professional aspirations.
